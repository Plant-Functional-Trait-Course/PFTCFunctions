<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of PFTCFunctions is to create unique hashcodes for each individual leaf (envelope) from the Plant FUnctional Trait Course.
Peru: seed = 1
Svalbard: seed = 32
Chile seed = 6

## Installation

You can install PFTCFunctions from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("audhalbritter/PFTCFunctions")
```
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(PFTCFunctions)
## create list with all envelope codes. And show the first five values
all_codes <- get_PFTC_envelope_codes(seed = 1)
all_codes$hashcode[1:5]
```
